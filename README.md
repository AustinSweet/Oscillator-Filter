Core goals: to utilize existing frameworks in order to best showcase an understanding of DSP code.

This program uses a combination of a FIR filter and a LFO in order to isolate a sweeping frequency cutoff in a visualizer. A dual-voiced midi synth provides steady input. To best obersve the isolated frequencies, the 0th and 1st octaves should be played and stopped, freezing the visualization. Any right angles indicate the current isolated frequency. There is an upper sweep as well, but it's far less obvious due to the higher Hz rate.
